# Protsh

Protish is a humble unix shell aimed to be nothing more than educative.

Feel free to use the code as you wish and ,if you think you can improve it, go for it!

The test folder contains a number of scripts that may be a simple introduction to common syscalls. Using the command:
```
man 2 <syscall>
```
shall give you a very good description (for the most part) of the syscall, and some include a C code exemple too.

# Installation

It will work on unix systems, you can use the Makefile:

```
make
```

or you can use another compiler as you wish.
